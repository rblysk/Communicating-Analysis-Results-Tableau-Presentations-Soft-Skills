# COMMUNICATING-ANALYSIS-RESULTS-TABLEAU-PRESENTATIONS-SOFT-SKILLS

**POWERPOINT / SOFT SKILLS**

**GRADED TASK BOTH TOPICS**

-----

**Summary**

You work as a data analyst at “AdwentureWorks'' company. 

You should be familiar with this company’s data from previous sprints. In case you need to refresh your memory about this data you can find a schema for this database here.

**Please choose one task from the following combinations:**

1. Executive Leadership and Finance
2. Executive Leadership and Sales
3. Executive Leadership and Operations
4. Executive Leadership and HR

-----


**Note:** if you have very little experience regarding what these departments are concerned with, you are strongly advised to research a bit deeper into it – whether it is reading about it online, talking to people working in those areas or discussing this in stand-ups/open sessions. At least basic awareness of the most common business processes and departments will help you immensely in almost any kind of career.

**You are asked to provide 1 dashboard or spreadsheet which you will then use for 2 presentations for each of the departments.** 

If you wish, you can have 2 slightly modified versions of the dashboard / spreadsheet to better suit each of the two presentations.

**Keep in mind** that both presentations and spreadsheet /dashboard should be prepared with your audience in mind. 

**Make sure** that you apply what you learned in this sprint and that you can provide not only data but also insights and communicate them.

-----

**Evaluation criteria for the dashboard / spreadsheet are as follows:**

**1.** Write SQL queries to extract needed data, these queries should be well documented, with indentation and provided as custom queries in dashboard/spreadsheet. Keep in mind which departments you are presenting your data to so you provide them with relevant data.

**2.** Remember how spreadsheet / dashboard should be structured and what data should be provided. Make sure you use techniques provided in the materials of this sprint and other sprints not only to analyze data but to communicate your findings clearly.

**3.** Remember to have clear labels, good naming conventions and other elements, so the audience who looks at your spreadsheet/dashboard can understand it without your explanations. We will be assessing the clarity and structure.

**4.** Think about possible data literacy levels for each of the 2 departments and how they impact your spreadsheet / dashboard. We will assess if you could adjust your analysis and insights for them.

**5.** Think about the next steps, these will be very useful when doing presentations: what are the drawbacks of your analysis, and what further analysis or recommendations do you have? We will be assessing this in the next part, the presentations.

-----

**For the next step, provide 2 presentations and present them.**

**One presentation** of your choice should be a very brief one: **~2 minutes.**

**The other** one should be a more detailed one, taking **~10 minutes.**

In case your audience has more questions, this limit may be exceeded. For the presentations, you will be assessed on:

**1.** Slide content: What is presented and how much information is on each slide.

**2.** Slide appearance: How content is distributed on a slide, animations, charts, tables, size of objects, etc.

**3.** Techniques used to hold the audience's attention: Asking questions, storytelling, etc.

**4.** Your body language and voice: They should help you and match the message you want to deliver.

**5.** Assurance and self-confidence
